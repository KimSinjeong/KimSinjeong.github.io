    #   Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

    #   I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## About Me

I am a master student in Computer Science at ETH Zurich. I am interested in geometric computer vision (a.k.a 3D vision), feature extraction, and robot vision.

As an undergraduate researcher, I participated in research projects on Weakly-supervised Semantic Segmentation, Self-supervised Event Feature Embedding, and Geometry-aware keypoint descriptor at [Visual Intelligence Lab. @ KAIST](http://vi.kaist.ac.kr/) (PI: [Prof. Kukjin Yoon](https://sites.google.com/site/kjyoon/)). I also previously worked as an undergraduate researcher at [Neuro-Machine Augmented Intelligence Laboratory @ KAIST](http://nmail.kaist.ac.kr/wordpress/) (PI: [Prof. Sungho Jo](http://nmail.kaist.ac.kr/wordpress/index.php/professor-jo-sungho/)).
